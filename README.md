# Defold Hitbox Editor

(barebones README to be edited later)

Tool that allows you to draw hitboxes on top of individual frames of .atlas animations, and then export them to a .lua table, which stores the width, height, position and properties of each hitbox, as well as additional properties for animations. Uses the [**imagesize**](github.com/leafo/imagesize/) library, and the [**Druid**](github.com/Insality/druid) framework for the editor's UI.
